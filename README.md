# Semester-Project

This project goes over the integration of AI and Machine Learning in NVIDIA's DLSS, a groundbreaking technology that fixes the imbalance in video graphics. DLSS intelligently renders images at a lower resolution and upscales them to a higher resolution, delivering enhanced performance and visual quality. Crucial to its success, the role of AI and Machine Learning in DLSS includes convolutional autoencoder training and real-time image processing, which enables DLSS to dynamically upscale images while preserving smooth motion and detail. As a milestone in video graphics, DLSS highlights the transformative power of AI and Machine Learning in redefining the future of interactive media.
